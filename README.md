## 📦 Project Structure

```
├── csv_to_sql.py                # Script to import raw CSV files into a SQL database
├── dataset_link.txt            # URL(s) or source references for the dataset(s)
├── python+sql_ecommerce.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook: SQL + Python analysis and visualizations
└── Questions.txt               # List of business questions guiding the analysis
```

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Database**: MySQL (or equivalent SQL engine)
- **Python**: Jupyter Notebook environment
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `mysql-connector-python` (or `sqlalchemy`) for database integration
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for visualizations

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

1. **Import Stage (`csv_to_sql.py`)**
   - Parses CSV files from the source folder
   - Cleans and formats data
   - Loads them into structured SQL tables

2. **Exploratory Analysis (`python+sql_ecommerce.ipynb`)**
   - Executes SQL queries within the Notebook to answer business questions from `Questions.txt`
   - Combines SQL and Python to calculate metrics and trends
   - Renders visualizations (e.g. sales trends, category performance)

3. **Iterative Question‑Driven Analysis**
   - Business and analytical questions are captured in `Questions.txt`
   - The Notebook uses these to drive SQL queries and result interpretation

## 🔍 Key Insights (typical examples)

- Top-performing product categories by revenue  
- Monthly/annual sales trends  
- Customer retention and repeat‑purchase analysis  
- Highest‑value customers and geographic insights

## 📝 Questions Template

Review the file `Questions.txt` to find all guiding questions such as:
- How many orders were placed each year?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- Who are the most valuable customers?

These questions are actively answered via embedded SQL and Python in the Notebook.
